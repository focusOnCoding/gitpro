<# Appendix B: Embedding Git in your
Applications
If your application is for developers, chances are good that it could benefit from integration with
source control. Even non-developer applications, such as document editors, could potentially
benefit from version-control features, and Git’s model works very well for many different
scenarios.
If you need to integrate Git with your application, you have essentially two options: spawn a shell
and call the git command-line program, or embed a Git library into your application. Here we’ll
cover command-line integration and several of the most popular embeddable Git libraries.#>
